# ADS-1115 Driver
Driver used for ADS-1115 Module
# Information 
The ADS1115 16-Bit 4-Channel I2C ADC signal conversion circuit is used to create 4 ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) channels with 16-bit resolution, which communicate with microcontrollers or embedded computers (Raspberry Pi) via a simple I2C interface using only 2 signal pins (Data, Clock). This circuit is applied to read signals from modules or sensors that receive analog signals with high accuracy, or to add additional ADC pins for circuits that only have digital signal pins.
# Connection Diagram
We use a potentiometer 100kÎ© for testing.
